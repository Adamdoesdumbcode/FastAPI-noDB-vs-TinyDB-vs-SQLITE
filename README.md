hi. i wanna get into APIS, developing and integrating them. yk the whole thang. hopefully making more projects will help
## title?????? 
uh so the title was right b4?? it used to be each file was a single API, one with no db, one with tinydb (legit DOGshit), and one with sqlite ( the goat). i ended up ditching everything xept sqlite and seperating all the files for different reasons. one for endpoints one for endpoint functionality. the whole shabang
